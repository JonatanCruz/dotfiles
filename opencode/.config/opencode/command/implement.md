# Implement Feature

Implement $ARGUMENTS with comprehensive approach:

## Analysis Phase
1. Examine implementation requirements and detect technology context
2. Identify framework-specific patterns (React, Vue, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
3. Assess security, performance, and quality implications

## Planning Phase
1. Choose appropriate architecture and design patterns
2. Break down into manageable components
3. Identify dependencies and integration points

## Implementation Phase
1. Generate code following framework best practices
2. Apply security validation throughout development
3. Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
4. Add comprehensive logging and debugging support

## Validation Phase
1. Review code quality and maintainability
2. Check security vulnerabilities
3. Verify performance considerations
4. Ensure proper documentation

## Integration Phase
1. Update related documentation
2. Add or update tests (unit, integration)
3. Consider deployment and rollout strategy

## Use Context7 for:
- Framework-specific patterns and documentation
- Official best practices and conventions
- API reference and usage examples

## Use Serena for:
- Code structure analysis
- Refactoring recommendations
- Cross-file dependencies

## Guidelines
- Follow project's existing patterns and conventions
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability
- Include error handling and validation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Consider backward compatibility
- Think about testing strategy
